# AWS Cloud Security Posture Assessment (CSPM) – Demo

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to assess and improve an insecure AWS environment using **AWS native security services** and **industry best practices**.  
It is designed as a **client-facing portfolio project** to showcase visibility, compliance, and remediation capabilities.

## 🎯 Objective
Simulate misconfigurations in AWS, then **detect and remediate** them to reduce risk and improve compliance.  
Deliverables include a **board-ready compliance report** and a **remediation roadmap**.

## 💡 Why This Matters
Cloud misconfigurations are among the top causes of breaches.  
Risks addressed in this demo include:
- Public S3 bucket exposure  
- Overly permissive IAM roles  
- Open SSH ports (`0.0.0.0/0`)  
- Lack of API visibility (missing CloudTrail)  
- Non-compliance with CIS, NIST, SOC 2  

## ✅ Business Value
- **Reduced Risk:** Detect and close high-impact vulnerabilities.  
- **Audit Readiness:** Benchmark against CIS AWS Foundations.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Aggregate findings in AWS Security Hub.  
- **Executive Reporting:** Compliance summaries for leadership and auditors.  

## 🛠️ Approach
1. **Baseline Review** – Check S3, IAM, Security Groups, CloudTrail.  
2. **Enable Visibility** – Deploy AWS Config & CloudTrail.  
3. **Compliance Benchmarking** – Apply CIS AWS Foundations.  
4. **Centralised Reporting** – Aggregate via Security Hub.  
5. **Remediation Roadmap** – Prioritise fixes by severity & compliance impact.  

## 🚀 Key Outcomes
- Public S3 buckets identified and remediated.  
- Insecure IAM admin access flagged.  
- Open SSH ports closed.  
- CloudTrail enabled with proper logging.  
- CIS benchmark conformance packs deployed.  
- Security Hub + GuardDuty integrated for ongoing threat detection.  

## 📊 Tools & Services Used
- **AWS S3** (storage & bucket policies)  
- **AWS IAM** (identity & access control)  
- **AWS CloudTrail** (audit logging)  
- **AWS Config** (compliance tracking)  
- **AWS Security Hub** (findings aggregation)  
- **AWS GuardDuty** (threat detection)  
- **AWS Trusted Advisor** (best practice checks)  

## 📈 Strategic Alignment
- Improve governance (CIS, SOC 2 readiness).  
- Reduce threat surface (close high-risk misconfigs).  
- Enable resilience (ongoing monitoring & alerting).  
- Support secure growth in cloud environments.  

## 🔮 Next Steps (For Clients)
1. Deploy CSPM audit in the client’s AWS environment.  
2. Present **board-ready findings** with risk heatmaps.  
3. Run remediation workshops with DevOps/Cloud teams.  
4. Establish ongoing compliance dashboards.

### 📘 Summary
This CSPM demo shows how to:  
- Detect and remediate common AWS misconfigurations.  
- Benchmark against **CIS Foundations** and other frameworks.  
- Build a repeatable, client-facing **Cloud Security Health Check** service.
